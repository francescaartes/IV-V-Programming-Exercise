# IV-Programming-Exercise
 Create programs using Java, Python, and C++ language for each of the following problems. 1. Body Mass Index Program Enhancement  In Programming Exercise in Lesson 3 you were asked to design a program that calculates a person’s body mass index (BMI). Recall from that exercise that the BMI is often used to determine whether a person with a sedentary lifestyle is overweight or underweight for his or her height. A person’s BMI is calculated with the following formula:                               BMI = Weight × 703 / Height^22. Distance Traveled The distance a vehicle travels can be calculated as follows:                        Distance = Speed × Time For example, if a train travels 40 miles per hour for three hours, the distance traveled is 120 miles. Design a program that asks the user for the speed of a vehicle (in miles per hour) and how many hours it has traveled. It should then use a loop to display the distance the vehicle has traveled for each hour of that time period.
